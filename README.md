# 📝 Task Tracker CLI

**Task Tracker CLI** is a simple yet powerful command-line tool that helps you manage and track your tasks efficiently. It allows you to add, update, delete, and list tasks while maintaining their status (`todo`, `in-progress`, or `done`).  

This project is built using **Node.js** and uses a **JSON file** for storing tasks—keeping it lightweight and dependency-free.
